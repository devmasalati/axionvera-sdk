## 🌟 Overview

Building on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform requires managing RPC connections, building XDR transactions, simulating contract calls for resource limits, and handling cryptographic signatures. The Axionvera SDK abstracts these complexities away. Whether you're building a frontend dApp or a backend service, the SDK provides the tools you need to interact with the Axionvera ecosystem safely and efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- **Network Management**: Seamlessly connect to Stellar networks (Testnet/Mainnet) via Soroban RPC.
- **Transaction Lifecycle**: Build, simulate, prepare, and submit Soroban contract call transactions in a few lines of code.
- **Resilience**: Built-in HTTP interceptors with exponential backoff for robust RPC interactions, handling rate limits automatically.
- **Configurable Logging**: Built-in logger with automatic sensitive data redaction for easier debugging.
- **Vault Contract Module**: Out-of-the-box support for the Axionvera Vault contract (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `balance`, `claimRewards`).
- **Faucet Client**: Automated account funding for Testnet and Futurenet environments.
- **SEP-0007 Support**: Standardized URI generation for mobile wallet deep-linking and QR code payments.
- **Wallet Integration**: Flexible `WalletConnector` interface, including a built-in `LocalKeypairWalletConnector` for server-side or automated signing.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using the Axionvera SDK, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher is recommended.
- **Package Manager**: npm, yarn, or pnpm.
- **Stellar Account**: A funded Stellar account on your target network (Testnet or Mainnet) to pay for transaction fees.

---

## 📦 Installation

The SDK requires Node.js 18+ and has `@stellar/stellar-sdk` as a peer dependency.

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm install axionvera-sdk @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

**Using yarn:**
```bash
yarn add axionvera-sdk @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

**Using pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm add axionvera-sdk @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

### TypeScript Configuration

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` has `strict: true` for full type safety:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  }
}
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Here is a step-by-step guide to initializing the SDK, connecting a local wallet, and executing a transaction on the Vault contract.

```typescript
import { Keypair } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import {
  LocalKeypairWalletConnector,
  StellarClient,
  VaultContract
} from "axionvera-sdk";

// 1. Initialize the Stellar Client for the Testnet
const client = new StellarClient({ network: "testnet" });

// 2. Set up the Wallet Connector with your secret key
const keypair = Keypair.fromSecret(process.env.STELLAR_SECRET_KEY!);
const wallet = new LocalKeypairWalletConnector(keypair);

// 3. Initialize the Vault Contract wrapper
const vault = new VaultContract({
  client,
  contractId: process.env.AXIONVERA_VAULT_CONTRACT_ID!,
  wallet
});

// 4. Execute a transaction
async function run() {
  try {
    console.log("Depositing 1000 units into the vault...");
    
    // The SDK automatically handles building, simulating, signing, and submitting the transaction
    const depositResult = await vault.deposit({ amount: 1000n });
    
    console.log("Transaction successful!");
    console.log("Result:", depositResult);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Transaction failed:", error);
  }
}

run();
```

## � Migration Guide

**Coming from Stellar Classic (stellar-sdk v10)?** 

We've prepared a comprehensive [Migration Guide](./docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) to help you transition from Classic operations to Soroban smart contracts. The guide covers:

- **Paradigm shift**: Understanding the difference between Classic Operations and Soroban `InvokeHostFunction`
- **Side-by-side examples**: Compare how you used to build transactions vs. the simplified Axionvera SDK approach
- **Common scenarios**: Migrating payment services, data storage, and multi-signature workflows
- **Best practices**: Error handling, resource estimation, and debugging in Soroban

Whether you're migrating an existing dApp or starting fresh, the migration guide bridges the knowledge gap and gets you productive quickly.

## 🏗️ Module Architecture

The SDK is organized into clear layers to keep concerns separated:

### `src/client/`
- **`StellarClient`**: Main entry point for Soroban RPC connections
- **`FaucetClient`**: Automated account funding for test networks

### `src/contracts/`
- **`VaultContract`**: High-level wrapper for the Axionvera Vault contract

### `src/wallet/`
- **`WalletConnector`**: Interface for wallet signing
- **`LocalKeypairWalletConnector`**: Built-in keypair signer for server-side use

### `src/utils/`
- **`networkConfig`**: Default RPC URLs and network passphrases
- **`transactionBuilder`**: Helpers to build Soroban contract calls
- **`concurrencyQueue`**: Rate limiting for high-volume apps
- **`sep7`**: URI generation for wallet deep-linking
- **`httpInterceptor`**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **`logger`**: Built-in logging with sensitive data redaction

### `src/errors/`
- Typed error classes for different failure modes

## 📚 API Reference

For deep architectural details, see the [SDK Overview](./docs/sdk-overview.md) and [Usage Guide](./docs/usage-guide.md). Below is a summary of the core API classes:

### `StellarClient`
The core client wrapping the Soroban RPC connection.
- `getHealth()`: Check the health of the RPC node.
- `simulateTransaction(tx)`: Simulates a transaction to calculate fees and resource footprints.
- `prepareTransaction(tx)`: Attaches the simulation footprints and minimum fees to the transaction.
- `sendTransaction(tx)`: Submits a signed transaction to the network.
- `pollTransaction(hash, params)`: Polls the network until a transaction reaches a final state (`SUCCESS` or `FAILED`).
- `logLevel`: Property in `StellarClientOptions` to control SDK output visibility.

### `VaultContract`
A high-level abstraction for the Axionvera Vault smart contract.
- `deposit({ amount, from })`: Deposits tokens into the vault.
- `withdraw({ amount, from })`: Withdraws tokens from the vault.
- `getBalance({ account })`: Retrieves the vault balance for a specific account.
- `getVaultShares({ account })`: Queries the user's balance of the Vault's share token (read-only).
- `getExchangeRate()`: Queries the current conversion rate between 1 Share and the underlying asset (read-only).
- `claimRewards({ from })`: Claims pending rewards for the caller.

### `FaucetClient`
Automated funding for Testnet and Futurenet.
- `fundAccount(publicKey)`: Hits the correct Friendbot endpoint based on the client's network. Throws `FaucetRateLimitError` if throttled.

### `SEP-0007 Utilities`
Standardized URI generation for mobile wallet integration.
- `generateTransactionURI(xdr, callbackUrl)`: Generates a `web+stellar:tx` URI.
- `generatePayURI(destination, amount, assetCode, assetIssuer)`: Generates a `web+stellar:pay` URI.

### `WalletConnector` (Interface)
Implement this interface to integrate browser extension wallets (like Freighter) or use the provided `LocalKeypairWalletConnector` for backend/scripting services.
- `getPublicKey()`: Returns the public key of the connected wallet.
- `signTransaction(xdr, passphrase)`: Signs a prepared transaction XDR string and returns the signed XDR.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the SDK, check the following common problems:

- **Error: `Simulation failed`**
  This usually means the contract call reverted during simulation. Ensure your account has sufficient XLM for fees, the contract ID is correct, you are passing the correct arguments, and the contract logic allows the operation.
- **Error: `Timed out waiting for transaction`**
  The transaction was submitted but not confirmed within the polling window. You may need to increase the `timeoutMs` parameter in `pollTransaction` or check if the network is heavily congested.
- **Rate Limiting (HTTP 429)**
  The SDK automatically retries on `429 Too Many Requests` using exponential backoff. If you consistently hit rate limits, consider configuring a private RPC provider URL instead of using the default public endpoints during `StellarClient` initialization.
